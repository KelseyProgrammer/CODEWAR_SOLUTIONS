If the statementa or statementb are more than one line, you need to add { and } at the head and tail of statements in JS, to keep the same indentation on Python and to put an end in Ruby where it indeed ends.\n// \n// For example, if we want to judge whether a number is odd or even, we can write code like this:function oddEven(n){\n// \n  // else            return \"even number\";\n  // if (n % 2 == 1) return \"odd number\";\n  // \n// }\n// If there is more than one condition to judge, we can use the compound if...else statement. For example:\n// if (age < 16)      return \"children\"\n// function oldYoung(age){\n  // else               return \"old man\"\n  // else if (age < 50) return \"young man\"   //use \"else if\" if needed\n  // \n// }\n// This function returns a different value depending on the parameter age.\n// \n// Looks very complicated? Well, JS and Ruby also support the ternary operator and Python has something similar too:\n// \n// condition ? statementa : statementb\n// Condition and statement separated by \"?\", different statement separated by \":\" in both Ruby and JS; in Python you put the condition in the middle of two alternatives. The two examples above can be simplified with ternary operator:\n// return n%2 == 1 ? \"odd number\" : \"even number\";\n// function oddEven(n){\n  // function oldYoung(age){\n// }\n// }\n  // return age < 16 ? \"children\" : age < 50 ? \"young man\" : \"old man\";\n// \n// Task:\n// Complete function saleHotdogs/SaleHotDogs/sale_hotdogs, function accepts 1 parameter:n, n is the number of hotdogs a customer will buy, different numbers have different prices (refer to the following table), return how much money will the customer spend to buy that number of hotdogs.number of hotdogs\tprice per unit (cents)\n// \n// n >= 5 and n < 10\t95\n// n < 5\t100\n// \n// n >= 10\t90\n// You can use if..else or ternary operator to complete it.\n// \n// When you have finished the work, click \"Run Tests\" to see if your code is working properly.In the end, click \"Submit\" to submit your code and pass this kata.\nfunction saleHotdogs(n) {\n  return n < 5 ? n * 100 : n < 10 ? n * 95 : n * 90;\n}\n// 156: How many stairs will Suzuki climb in 20 years? - lvl 8\n// Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual.

Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.\n// \n// The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced.
